= Using Foreman Webhooks

A webhook is a way for a web page or web application to provide other applications with information in real time. 
Webhooks are only triggered after an event occurs. 
For example, when a user places an online order, a webhook makes an HTTP request to a pre-configured URL. 
The request usually contains details of the event.

An event triggers callbacks, such as sending an e-mail confirming an online purchase. 
The typical use case for webhooks in {Project} is making a call to a monitoring system when a host is created or deleted.

Webhooks use a fire-and-forget message exchange pattern. 
The application sending the request does not wait for the response, or ignores it.
Webhooks are not designed to call generic APIs.

Because webhooks use HTTP, no new infrastructure needs be added to existing web services.

{ProjectServer} does not support receiving webhooks.
