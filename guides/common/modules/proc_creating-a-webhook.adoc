. Click *Create Webhook*.
. Click *Subscribe to field* to select an event.

  When using the shellhooks plugin, the URL should be in the form of `https://{smartproxy.example.com}:{smartproxy_port}/shellhooks/my_script`.

. Enter the HTTP Content Type.
  For example, application/json, application/xml or text/plain depending on the payload.
. Optional: Provide HTTP headers as JSON. ERB is also allowed.

.Example HTTP headers

To pass arguments into a shellhook script, create the following HTTP headers:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
{
  "X-Shellhook-Arg-1": "<%= @object.content_view_version_id %>,
  "X-Shellhook-Arg-2": "<%= @object.content_view_name %>
}
----

Ensure the content renders to a valid JSON. Also, only pass safe fields like database ID, name or labels which do not include new lines or quote characters.

When configuring webhooks with endpoints with non-standard HTTP or HTTPS ports, an SELinux port must be assigned, see {InstallingProjectDocURL}configuring-selinux-to-ensure-access-on-custom-ports_satellite[Configuring SELinux to Ensure Access to Satellite on Custom Ports] in _Installing Satellite Server From A Connected Network_.
