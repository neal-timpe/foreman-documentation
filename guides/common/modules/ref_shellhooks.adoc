You can install a {SmartProxy} Shellhooks plugin that exposes executables using a REST HTTPS API.

Scripts must be placed in `/var/lib/foreman-proxy/shellhooks` as executables with only alphanumeric characters and underscores in the name.

The HTTPS payload is passed using standard input, optional command line arguments can be provided using X-Shellhook-Arg-1 _to_ N.

The HTTP method must be POST. An example URL would be: `https://{smartproxy.example.com}:{smartproxy_port}/shellhooks/my_script`.

Authorization with {Project} client checkbox must be enabled for each webhook to authorize a call.

Standard output and error are redirected to the {SmartProxy} log as messages with debug or warning levels respectively.

There is no return value from shellhook HTTPS calls.
